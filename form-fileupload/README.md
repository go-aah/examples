</p>

This example illustrates aah form file upload. It is easy to handle file uploads in aah. It works by calling (method) `Req.SaveFile` with form field name and destination path. The method returns file size on successful save.

```go
fileSize, err := Req.SaveFile("userProfileImage", "/Users/jeeva/user-profile-uploads")
```
