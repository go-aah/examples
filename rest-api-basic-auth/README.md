aah supports basic auth mechanism in two ways, choose per use case -

Realm | Description
----- | -----------
File | When you know a set of pre-defiend subjects (aka users), roles and permissions (roles and permissions values are optional though)
Dynamic | Subject information lies in Data Source (DB, API provider, etc). Implementing interfaces `authc.Authenticator` and `authz.Authorizer`

Learn more about [Security design](https://docs.aahframework.org/security-design.html), [Authentication](https://docs.aahframework.org/authentication.html) and [Authorization](https://docs.aahframework.org/authorization.html).
